<h2>Warranties &amp; Commercial Support</h2>

<p>
This is the <b>Community Edition</b> of the Kolab Groupware Server.
It is provided by Kolab Systems as fully <a href="http://fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware">Free Software</a>
and you can use it to the fullest extent and any purpose. There are no license
costs or other obligations other than those set forth in the respective
Free Software licenses of the various components. <b>There are no warranties
or guarantees of any kind, nor is there any guaranteed support.
You are running this software entirely at your own risk.</b>
</p>

<p>
There is a wide variety of commercial support options and warranties available
by <a href="/admin/kolab/kolabsystems.php">Kolab Systems AG</a> and its
network of partners, the Kolab Enterprise Community. This support comes with
access to the additionally quality assured and hardened <b>Certified Kolab</b>
edition, which like the community edition is fully available as Free Software,
so has all the advantages of the Community Edition and is free of hidden lock-in.
</p>

<p>
Kolab Systems AG will provide limited support for the Community Edition on
a case-by-case basis, but with no guaranteed response times, as availability permits,
and at rates that may be adjusted due to the work load at the time of the request.
<b>It is strongly recommended that for mission-critical professional deployments
of the Kolab Groupware Solution you at least choose one of the partially
self-supported On Demand support models.</b>
